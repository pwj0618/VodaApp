			"‘Forest bathing’ is a growing movement in the UK. Based on the Japanese nature-therapy practice called shinrin-yoku, the idea is to spend time in a wood or forest. It has nothing to do with actual bathing – there is no water involved – but rather, you ‘bathe’ in an environment surrounded by trees. It’s a simple, sensory practice, best done without your mobile phone. You walk through the trees, using your senses: enjoy the sound of birds, of leaves rustling in the breeze, the sight of dappled sunlight on the ground, the different tones and colors, the smell of the plants, the texture of tree bark. There is no fixed destination, no particular plan of where to go. It is meant to be a mindful practice, as opposed to a brisk walk in the countryside with the dog. It’s not recommended that you rush it. Rather, give yourself the time to focus your attention in the present moment, to slow your pace."

When we’re feeling anxious and overwhelmed, the best cure to calm our nerves is in a book. A 2009 study at the University of Sussex showed that reading was the best way to overcome stress, even over activities such as going on a walk or listening to music. Researchers measured participant’s heartrate and muscle tension and saw it took six minutes for readers to ease tensions once they began reading. The best news? It doesn’t matter what kind of book we read, as long as we’re engrossed in the content.",

			"Reduce tension and relieve pain",
			"The weightlessness you experience in water helps relieve tension in your arms, legs and back, soothing aching muscles and easing movement. Hydrotherapy also stimulates endorphin release, which helps relieve pain naturally and reduce muscle soreness. It's also a great way to recover after a tough workout or a stressful day.",
			"Breathe easy and de-stress",
			"Immersing yourself in warm water helps open your chest, increasing your lung capacity and oxygen intake. Your heart beats faster and the steam from the water clears your sinuses. Taking deep, slow breaths calms your body and helps you relax, relieving your mind and body from stress. Steam from a hot bath also works wonders for cold and flu symptoms like congestion and coughing. It gets the blood vessels in your face and nose moving and loosens any mucus blockage.",
			"Balance your hormones",
			"Hydrotherapy can be helpful for some chronic conditions. Bathing in cooler temperatures helps balance hormones released by the pituitary gland while warm water bathing can increase serotonin levels, the brain chemical associated with happiness and well-being.",
			"Regulate your body temperature",
			"There’s nothing better than stepping into a warm tub on a cold winter day. Alternatively, jumping into a pool of cool water on a hot, sticky day is just as refreshing. Adjust your bath temperature according to the season to get your body temperature back to a comfortable place.",
			"Improve your sleep quality",
			"For optimal sleep, many sleep experts recommend setting your bedroom temperature between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit. But a hot bath before bed can yield similar results. At night, your body temperature drops naturally to signal the production of melatonin, the sleeping hormone. Soaking in a warm bath will raise your body temperature, and exiting will more rapidly cool it down, better preparing you for a good night's rest."

			"Here are some ideas on how to practice a tech free day:",
			"Schedule it. Because our lives are so intertwined with technology, it’s hard to spontaneously have a tech free day that isn’t caused by a blackout or a dead zone. Put your tech free day in your schedule, and plan accordingly. Let your family know about it (get them to join you). Automate what you can (ie: if you have blog or social media posts that need to go out). Figure out how you can be contacted in case of emergencies. Plan what you’re going to do. When we’re bored, we reach for the phones. It has become a common habit that nobody blinks an eye anymore. Plan the activities you’re going to do. Have back up activities. Don’t think you’re planning a full schedule that’s going to tire you out. Think about it. Maybe you can read a book. How long does it take you to read a book? It can take up the entire day! Maybe your family can go on a picnic at the park. That can take up an entire day, too. Maybe you can garden in the morning, complete the DIY project in the afternoon, and give yourself a mani-pedi nightspot your tech gadgets away. Out of sight, out of mind. I recommend getting a box or container and filling it with the items you’ll need for your tech free day plus a written-out plan or schedule. For example, put in the book, a puzzle, a manicure kit, a DIY project, etc. On your tech free day, exchange these items with your gadgets and place the box away. For bigger technology like the tv or desktop computer, cover them up! Go old school. Some drawbacks to a tech free day is not being able to use the helpful technology we have. If you’re a runner, you probably use a step counter connected to your phone. If you’re a baker, you probably use one of the many recipe apps out there. Most of us use your phones’ cameras to capture and share memories. Exchange the new tech for old tech. Use a pedometer. Use an actual cookbook (see if you can borrow grandma’s cookbook from a family member). Use a disposable camera. You can get the pictures developed and order a cd with digital copies to go along with them.",
